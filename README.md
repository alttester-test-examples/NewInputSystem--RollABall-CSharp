# RollABall - CSharp tests

This project contains C# AltTester tests for a project using the New Input System.
The tested actions are: move mouse, click, begin/move/end touch, swipe, key down/key up, press key, tilt, scroll .

## Before running the tests
‚ùó Starting with version 2.0.0, the AltTester Desktop must be running on your PC while the tests are running.

- Install the [AltTesterDesktop](https://alttester.com/alttester/#pricing), then open it.
- To run the tests, you must include the AltTester Unity SDK in the project. To do that, you can choose between the following ways:
1. Add the AltTester Unity SDK submodule to the project
    - use ``git submodule update --init`` command to pull the git submodule;
    - make sure that the submodule added is on the master branch (you can use the following command ``git checkout master`` in the <i>Assets/AltTester-Unity-SDK</i> folder);
    - also, if you already have the project, you should make a ``git pull`` on the master branch, in order to ensure that you are using the latest version of AltTester.

2. Download AltTester Unity SDK and import it into Unity 
    - download the AltTester Unity SDK from the Altom website (https://alttester.com/alttester/#pricing) or using this link https://alttester.com/app/uploads/AltTester/sdks/AltTester.unitypackage;
    - import the package into the project (drag-n-drop the package in the Assets folder);
    - a pop-up will appear, select All and click on Import.
